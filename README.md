# Market Review LDA Analysis

## 🎯 Overview

This project performs Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic modeling on customer review data to extract meaningful insights for marketing strategies. The system processes raw text reviews, identifies hidden topics, and generates comprehensive visualizations and marketing recommendations.

## ✨ Key Features

- **Automated Text Preprocessing**: Intelligent cleaning, tokenization, and lemmatization of review text
- **Dynamic Topic Discovery**: LDA modeling to uncover hidden themes in customer feedback
- **Rich Visualizations**: Interactive charts and comprehensive analysis reports
- **Marketing Insights**: Actionable recommendations based on topic analysis
- **Modular Architecture**: Clean, maintainable code structure with reusable components

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Run Complete Analysis

```bash
python main.py
```

The interactive pipeline will guide you through:
1. Text preprocessing and data cleaning
2. Dictionary and corpus creation
3. LDA model training with optimal parameters
4. Visualization generation and insight extraction

## 📊 Sample Outputs

### Topic Distribution Analysis

The system generates comprehensive topic distribution visualizations showing how topics are distributed across your review dataset:

## 🔧 Advanced Usage

### Custom Parameters

```python
from src.training.lda_trainer import train_lda_model

# Train with custom parameters
model_results = train_lda_model(
    corpus_path="src/models/review_corpus.mm",
    dictionary_path="src/models/review_dictionary.dict",
    num_topics=8,
    alpha='auto',
    eta='auto',
    passes=20,
    iterations=400
)
```

### Batch Processing

```python
from src.analysis.preprocessing import process_reviews_pipeline

# Process multiple datasets
for dataset in datasets:
    results = process_reviews_pipeline(
        csv_path=dataset,
        output_dir="src/data/processed",
        verbose=True
    )
```

## 📊 Performance Metrics

The system automatically calculates and reports:

- **Topic Coherence**: Measures how semantically similar topic words are
- **Perplexity**: Model's predictive performance on held-out data
- **Word Coverage**: Percentage of vocabulary captured by topics
- **Topic Diversity**: How distinct topics are from each other
